# PacMan-OpenGL

_Inspired by the classic Pacman arcade game, 'Maze Munchers' is a modern rendition that combines 
nostalgic gameplay with contemporary graphics and mechanics._ 




The project aims to recreate the immersive experience of the original game while introducing new elements to enhance gameplay and 
engagement. Utilising OpenGL for graphics rendering and GLUT for user interaction, 'Maze Munchers 
presents players with a series of mazes populated by pellets and ghosts.

The player, controlling a character known as a 'muncher,' navigates the maze, consuming pellets to score points while evading 
the ghosts, which seek to impede progress. Key features of Maze Munchers include intuitive controls 
and strategic use of power-ups to enhance gameplay complexity. The game's design emphasises 
entertainment and cognitive engagement, requiring players to devise strategies to maximise their score 
while avoiding ghost encounters. Maze Munchers offers a compelling gaming experience that appeals 
to a wide audience through its blend of classic gameplay and modern design principles.

The project showcases the application of OpenGL and GLUT in developing interactive and visually appealing 
games, demonstrating their potential for creating immersive gaming experiences.
